#Regex Use Dynamic Value (Paw Extension)

A [Paw Extension](http://luckymarmot.com/paw/extensions/) to match and use a pattern in an input string. It uses the JavaScript [match](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/match) method, so the regular expression syntax must follow the JavaScript syntax (see [RegExp](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp) object).
