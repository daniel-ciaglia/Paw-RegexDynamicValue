#Regex Dynamic Value (Paw Extension)

A Paw Extension to match and replace a pattern in an input string. It uses the JavaScript [replace](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace) method, so the regular expression syntax must follow the JavaScript syntax (see the [RegExp](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp) object).
